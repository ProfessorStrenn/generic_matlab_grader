# generic_matlab_grader
This module provides a console-based front end for using the Matlab testing framework as an assignment grader.  It's main goals are to:

*  Allow students to use the grader **without requiring them to know how to invoke unit tests**.
*  Provide a simple report that includes a main score and optional extra credit.
*  Provide a small set of embedded utility functions (like clr, which clears everything, including figures and classes)
*  Provide a template for creating new assignment graders.
*  Utilize the Matlab testing framework.
