This module provides a console-based front end for using the Matlab testing framework as an assignment grader.  It's main goals are to:

*  Utilize the Matlab testing framework.
*  Allow students to use the grader *without requiring them to know how to invoke unit tests*.
*  Provide a simple report that includes a main score and optional extra credit.
*  Provide a template for creating new assignment graders.
